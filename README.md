# Forelec : Energy Consumption Forecast

This repository provides a methodology to analyze and build models for the purpose of forecasting.
It is aimed at ML practitioners who want to go beyond implementing standard models : 
- understand the dataset
- find patterns
- build tailored models 


### Difficulty Levels
This course has three levels of difficulty, with increasing level of depth and complexity:
* Beginner: Learning basic tools and concepts for analysis & forecasting (Libraries, OOP).
* Intermediate: Understanding concepts of time series data and applying models
* Advanced: in-depth analysis and model customization


### Media
A video will be posted on youtube for full explanations.
Along this course, I encourage you to choose your own dataset and compare your results.
Please post your results in the comments section of the video or create an issue in this repository.
