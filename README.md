# Forelec : Energy Consumption Forecast

This repository provides an introduction to time series analysis and forecasting. 
Currently, it is designed to be used during workshop sessions. In the future, Youtube videos will be added
so it can be learnt independently.

### Difficulty Levels
This course has three levels of difficulty, with different objectives:
* Beginner: Learn basic tools (libraries, OOP) and concepts (trend, correlation) for analysis & forecasting.
* Intermediate: Understanding concepts of time series data (distribution, seasonality, stationarity) and applying ML models
* Advanced: in-depth analysis (eg Signal Processing) and model customization (writing custom functions & algorithms from scratch)


### Media
Explanation videos will be posted on youtube for full explanations.
Along this course, I encourage you to choose your own dataset and compare your results.
Please post your results in the comments section of the video or create an issue in this repository.
